        <h2>Introduction to Hyperlinks</h2>
        <p>The evolution of hyperlinks presents an intriguing exploration of the development 
            and use of digital communication on the web.
            From their humble beginnings to their widespread use today, hyperlinks have played a crucial role in connecting web pages and facilitating navigation for users.
            In the early days of the internet, hyperlinks were simple text-based links that allowed users to move from one webpage to another with just a click. As technology advanced, the introduction of graphical user interfaces and HTML coding made it possible to create more visually appealing and interactive hyperlinks.
            Here is a simplified timeline that focuses on important technologies, applications, and milestones in the history of hyperlinks.</p>
